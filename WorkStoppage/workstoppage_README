The following is a definition of:  WORK STOPPAGE DATA (WS)

Survey Description:  The series covers all work stoppages--strikes and 
lockouts--involving 1,000 workers or more and lasting one full shift or 
longer.  The Bureau does not attempt to differentiate between strikes and 
lockouts.  The series does not measure the indirect or secondary effect of 
stoppages on other establishments whose employees are idled by material 
shortages or lack of services.  For the series, a stoppage is considered 
to be ended when the number of workers involved dips below 1,000.

The series presents annual data from 1947 through 1981 and annual and 
monthly data thereafter; it is not comparable with the one terminated in 
1981 that covered stoppages involving six workers or more.

Summary Data Available:  The number of stoppages beginning in the period.

The number of stoppages in effect in the period, comprising those that 
began in the period and those that began earlier and continued into the 
period.

The number of workers directly involved in stoppages beginning in the 
period.

Thte number of workers directly involved in stoppages in effect in the 
period.

The total number of workdays lost by workers directly involved in the 
stoppages in effect in the period.

Total workdays lost in the stoppages in effect, as a percent of the number 
of workdays in the period multiplied by total national employment in the 
period.  (Private household, forestry, and fishery employees are excluded 
from total national employment.)

Frequency of Observations:  Monthly in all cases.

Annual Averages:  Annual data are available.

Data Characteristics:  All percent changes are stored with one decimal 
place.


Updating Schedule:  Updates become available about 3 weeks after the end of
each month.  All monthly figures are preliminary until final monthly and 
annual figures are issued in February.

The definition of a time series, its relationship to and the interrelationship
among series, data and mapping files is detailed below:

A time series refers to a set of data observed over an extended period of time
over consistent time intervals (i.e. monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually).  
BLS time series data are typically produced at monthly intervals and represent data 
ranging from a specific consumer item in a specific geographical area whose price 
is gathered monthly to a category of worker in a specific industry whose employment
rate is being recorded monthly, etc.

The FTP files are organized such that data users are provided with the following
set of files to use in their efforts to interpret data files:

a)  a series file (only one series file per survey)
b)  mapping files
c)  data files

The series file contains a set of codes which, together, compose a series 
identification code that serves to uniquely identify a single time series.  
Additionally, the series file also contains the following series-level information:

a) the period and year corresponding to the first data observation 
b) the period and year corresponding to the most recent data observation. 

The mapping files are definition files that contain explanatory text descriptions
that correspond to each of the various codes contained within each series
identification code.

The data file contains one line of data for each observation period pertaining to a
specific time series.  Each line contains a reference to the following:

a) a series identification code
b) year in which data is observed
c) period for which data is observed (M13, Q05, and S03 indicate annual averages)
d) value
e) footnote code (if available)

File Structure and Format: The following represents the file format used to define 
ws.series.  Note that the Field Numbers are for reference only; they do not exist 
in the database.  Data files are in ASCII text format.  Data elements are separated 
by tabs; the first record of each file contains the column headers for the data
elements stored in each field.  Each record ends with a new line character. 

Field #/Data Element	Length		Value(Example)		

1.  series_id		  17		WSU100

2.  measure_code	  3		001

3.  seasonal		  1		U				

4.  begin_year		  4		1947

5.  begin_period	  3		M13		
				
6.  end_year		  4		2002		

7.  end_period		  3		M01		
					
The series_id (WSU001) can be broken out into:

Code					Value

survey abbreviation	=		WS
seasonal (code) 	=		U
measure_code		=		001
