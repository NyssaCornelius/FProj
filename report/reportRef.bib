author = {John Kennan},
abstract = {This paper develops new evidence on the hazard function for strike duration, and on cyclical changes in this function, using data on contract strikes in U.S. manufacturing industries. A flexible duration model is estimated, and it is found that the hazard rate is generally a U-shaped function of strike age. The level of industrial production is found to have a significant positive effect on the hazard rate: strike duration is countercyclical. A convenient parametric model of heterogeneity and duration dependence is introduced, in which the logit of the hazard rate is a polynomial function of strike age, up to a random individual effect drawn from a beta distribution. Estimates of this ‘beta-logit’ model indicate that it is difficult to detect the influence of unobserved heterogeneity on the aggregate hazard function for strike duration.}

abstract = {This paper examines a common assumption of much of the research on class relations in capitalist economies that workers' collective action improves the economic standing of the working class. Specifically, we utilize a quarterly, time-series analysis to test hypotheses about the impact of changes in union membership and strike activity on changes in labor's share and its three components—changes in employment, compensation, and net revenue—during the post-World War II U.S. economy. We examine these hypotheses during a period of transition in the capital–labor accord that has dominated the U.S. political economy since 1949. We identify three periods during the capital–labor accord—the peak, the transitional, and the post-accord periods—and anticipate changing effects of strike activity and union membership on labor share and its components in the different periods. Our results provide mixed support for the hypotheses, but generally confirm our expectations that trends in strike activity and union membership were more instrumental for impacting labor's share and its components as hypothesized during the peak period of the capital–labor accord and less instrumental in later periods. In the post-accord period, in particular, strikes and unions become virtually irrelevant for the economic standing of workers, a result that bespeaks the changing configuration of class relations in the postwar U.S. economy.}
